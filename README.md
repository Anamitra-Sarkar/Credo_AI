Credo AI is a next-generation platform for combating misinformation, built on a unique "Two-Brain" AI architecture. It provides both immediate, high-confidence verdicts and deep, nuanced analysis for any piece of text or news article.

Key Features
Dual-AI Architecture: Utilizes two specialized DeBERTa-v3-large models for unparalleled analysis.

Brain 2 (The Specialist): A 99.9% accurate binary classifier for rapid FAKE/REAL verdicts.

Brain 1 (The Nuance Expert): A state-of-the-art 6-class classifier for deep, nuanced analysis of complex claims.

Live URL Analysis: Scrapes and analyzes content directly from news article URLs.

Gemini Intelligence Layer: Integrates Google's Gemini API to provide clear, conversational summaries of the AI's findings.

Multi-Page Platform: A polished Streamlit UI with live analysis, persistent session history, and detailed explanations of the AI.

File Structure
This repository contains the final, production-grade code for the Credo AI platform.

app.py: The complete, self-contained Streamlit web application. This is the file deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies required to run the application and training scripts.

Training Scripts
The following scripts represent the final, battle-tested code used to train our two champion AI models on high-performance GPUs (NVIDIA A100/H100).

train_brain2_A100_final_boss.py: The definitive script for training our "Specialist" model. It combines three massive datasets, performs intelligent deduplication, and achieves 99.9%+ accuracy.

train_brain1_A100_final_boss.py: The definitive script for training our "Nuance Expert." It combines four different LIAR datasets and uses an advanced class-weighting strategy to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this notoriously difficult benchmark.

refine_brain2_final.py: The surgical calibration script used to give our "Specialist" its final "masterclass." This script fine-tunes the model on a perfectly balanced dataset of pristine facts and high-quality fake news, correcting for real-world biases.
